## 🚀 Motivation
While we were working on our MASHINPAY solution we purchased Telpo thermal printers (M1s specifically) for our purpose, where after user makes payment there was a need to print a invoice file. The Telpo devices come with a native SDK and documentation for it. Since there was not an official and a customizable implementation of Telpo SDK for Flutter


## 🕹️ Usage

To get started, create a `TelpoController`:

```dart
final _telpoController = TelpoController();
```

## 💡 Motivation

While we were working on our MASHINPAY solution we purchased Telpo thermal printers (M1s specifically) for our purpose, where after the user makes payment there was a need to print an invoice file. The Telpo devices come with a native SDK and documentation for it. Since there was not an official and customizable implementation of Telpo SDK for Flutter

 
## 🕹️ Usage

To get started, create a `TelpoFlutterChannel`:

```dart
final _telpoFlutterChannel =  TelpoFlutterChannel();
```
